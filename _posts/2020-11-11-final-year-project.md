<center>For my 4th year project, I'm working on a vehicle cross-referencing service that aggregates listings from different providers and matches them based on their registration plate numbers.</center>

# Design

The goal is to deploy a Kubernetes cluster to orchestrate a network of Docker containers that:
- Scrape the information from the appropriate listing websites
- Run the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) / OCR (Optical Character Recognition) script to identify the registration plate
- Match it against current records in the database
- Feed the updated information into the database
- Deliver a smooth user experience using React
- Attempt to predict possible insurance prices

### The project is still ongoing and will be finished towards the end of April 2021
### I will be updating this page as time goes on and the project starts taking shape ðŸ˜ƒ
